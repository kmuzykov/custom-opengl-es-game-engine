Several iOS games created using custom OpenGL ES 2.0 engine.
============================

This repository contains my results of learning and experimenting with OpenGL ES 2.0.
  
##Contents:
### /Arkanoid
Very simple Arkanoid/Breakout game created using pure OpenGL ES 2.0.

### /Blender
Blender models, UV unwraps and .OBJ files for game objects (bowling ball, pins, arkanoid bricks,...).

### /Bowling
Bowling game created using same code that was used for Akanoid. Unfortunately, after XCode 5.1 came out Bullet Physics included in the engine doesn't build on iOS devices. So this project is freezed for now.

### /Engine
Custom game engine I've created while learning OpenGL ES 2.0. The idea was to create several games using it and thus practice some OpenGL and GLSL skills. 

It is very basic and you defenitelly shouldn't think of using it **anywhere**, but it might be helpful if you're learning OpenGL ES and stuck at something.


### /bullet-2.82-r2704
Bullet Physics engine used in bowling game. Please see LICENSE, AUTORS and other documents inside the folder. You can find more at http://bulletphysics.org/
